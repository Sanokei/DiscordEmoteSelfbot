# DiscordEmoteSelfbot
Use emotes in discord without nitro using a selfbot.

Create a config.py file with two variables
```python
token="api token"
prefix="prefix"
# I suggest using : because then you can use emotes like normal
```
run the `EmoteConvert.py` file or `EmoteConvert_noConsole.py`

Try typing `:<emote name>:` anywhere in your sentence

```
e.g. Hello :kms-1: World :ilyheart: :bleh:
```
